How to create certs for moss-backend:

In the `moss-backend/certificates` folder, run the following command:
`mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem 127.0.0.1 localhost`

This command creates a cert and key file in the certificates directory. 
These are self-signed certs that should be able to be replaced with whatever
certs you want to use.
