= The Plan

Ideal setup for the server is the following: Host website for user/admin to 
identify what they want monitored and what machines on the network are allowed to 
pull the config from the server. All the clients will be pointed to this server
to the pull the config that will be auto generated from the website.

== Technology Used

* `Leptos-rs` for the website and `trunkrs` for the hosting.
* `Serde` for serializing and deserializing communications with server and client.
