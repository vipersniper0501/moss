== Usage

There are two different ways of using the moss-client. Local mode and remote mode. Local mode allows you to use the moss-client without the need for a remote server. This is mainly to be used for quick iterations and development of different configs. Anything to be used for an actual deployment in a competition environment or production environment in general should make use of the remote mode which hosts the configs on a remote server, preventing users or prying eyes from determining what is being monitored.

=== Local Mode

To use moss-client in local mode, run the following commands: 

`moss-client -L <path to local config>`

=== Remote Mode

To use moss-client in remote mode (it connects to a remote instance of moss-server to retrieve it config), run the following commands:

`moss-client -R <IP/Url of remote server>`
